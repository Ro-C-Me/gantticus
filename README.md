# Gantticus

A small web application for drawing Gantt charts. Explicitly without a backend—the data remains in the browser’s local storage.

This project was created for two reasons:

I was appointed as an internal project manager at short notice and wanted to draw a Gantt chart—but couldn’t find suitable software. Open source programs were too complex or “old-fashioned” for my taste, and there were no licenses available for commercial alternatives. I could have used Excel or drawn bars “freehand” in Confluence—neither of which I found particularly effective.

My days of actively developing software are (unfortunately?) behind me. Still, I wanted to experience what “developing with AI” feels like and was looking for a small project to try it out. That’s how one thing led to another, and I spent a few evenings with Angular and Perplexity. My conclusion: it works quite well, but the manual back-and-forth between IDE and AI becomes rather tedious over time. The next step, therefore: try out GitHub Copilot.


This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.11.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
